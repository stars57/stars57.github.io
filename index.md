![](http://medhatare.com/images/medha_headshot.jpg){: .image-left target="_blank"} I’m an experienced research scientist in the learning sciences and technology use. What unites my research is an interest in examining factors that affect how both children and adults acquire new skills and knowledge, including individual differences, the environment, and the medium through which they learn. I am currently the Director of Research for the [**Learner Variability Project**](https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/learner-variability-project/){:target="_blank"}  at [**Digital Promise**](https://digitalpromise.org){:target="_blank"}, leading the synthesis of research on the cognitive, socio-emotional, and student background factors that affect K-12 learning, with the goal of increasing educators' and product developers' understanding of learner variability. This work also involves research translation, science communication, and studies of educational efficacy. I currently serve as a [**Learning Sciences Exchange Fellow**](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/announcing-2020-2022-learning-sciences-exchange-fellows/){:target="_blank"} through New America, working across sectors to promote early learning and help young children and their families thrive. 

I was previously an Associate Research Scientist at the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language where I led interdisciplinary efforts that resulted in key enhancements to educational curricula at large government institutions. For example, one line of research explored [**virtual reality and its application to language comprehension**](https://www.afcea.org/content/?q=Article-go-moscow-learn-russian-sort){:target="_blank"}. 

As a result of leading these multimillion dollar programs, I have a wide range of research and management skills including: relationship building with stakeholders; report writing and presentation for academic, government, and general public audiences; experimental and instructional design and evaluation; qualitative and quantitative assessment and analysis; and project administration, including managing personnel, timelines, and contractual budgets.

## [](#header-2) Research
My research interests span several major areas. Broadly, my work in the *learning sciences* examines individual differences (e.g., cognitive, biographical) that influence learners’ success in a variety of training environments (e.g., classrooms, online, immersion). I have studied the effects of *educational technology* interventions on learning outcomes and worked with educators on professional development and adoption of new training techniques. I also have expertise in children’s *cognitive and language development*, examining children’s acquisition of language, social, and conceptual knowledge through interactions with parents or in informal contexts such as museums.
