![](http://medhatare.com/images/medha_headshot.jpg){: .image-left target="_blank"} I'm a research scientist with more than 10 years of experience in the learning sciences and technology use.  My current research explores virtual reality and its application to language comprehension.  What unites all of my research is my interest in examining factors that affect how both children and adults acquire new skills and knowledge, including individual cognitive differences, their environment, and the media they are exposed to.  My role as an Associate Research Scientist at the University of Maryland’s Center for the Advanced Study of Language (CASL) has allowed me to lead multimillion-dollar interdisciplinary development efforts that have resulted in key enhancements to education through curriculum development and classroom technology introduction for learners at large educational institutions.  As part of leading large programs, I have also gained the soft skills needed to develop and maintain relationships, gather input from stakeholders and write proposals for business development, lead teams and reach consensus on project goals, and navigate university systems. I have deep experienced in presenting project proposals and briefing findings to both academic and non-academic audiences and am detail-oriented when managing multiple projects. My research and program management skills and knowledge include: learning principles from educational, developmental, and cognitive psychology; instructional design and evaluation; qualitative and quantitative assessment and analysis; and project administration, including managing personnel, timelines, and contractual budgets.

## [](#header-2) Research
My research interests span several major areas. Broadly, my work in the learning sciences has examining individual differences (e.g., cognitive, biographical) that influence learners’ success in a variety of training environments (e.g., classrooms, self-study, immersion).  I have also studied the role and effect of educational technology interventions on learning outcomes and worked with instructors on professional development and adoption of new training techniques.  I also have expertise in children's cognitive and language development, examining children’s acquisition of language, social, and conceptual knowledge through interactions with parents or in informal contexts such as museums.
